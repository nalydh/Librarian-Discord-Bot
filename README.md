<h2> 🚀 About the Project </h2>
The **Librarian Discord Bot** was developed to create an engaging and competitive reading environment for a group of friends who want to stay on track and push each other to read more. With features like **streak tracking**, **leaderboards**, and **customizable chapter templates**, it transforms any Discord server into a fun and motivating reading club.

<h2> 🛠️ **Tech Stack** </h2>
- **Language**: Python
- **Discord API**: Built using `discord.py` to integrate seamlessly with your Discord server.
- **Task Scheduling**: Uses asynchronous tasks to keep everyone on top of their game by sending out reminders and leaderboards.
- **Data Handling**: Efficient streak management and reminders using dictionaries to track user progress.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on **AWS** for 24/7 uptime, making sure your reading goals are always in check.

<h2> 🎉 **Features** </h2>
- **📅 Daily Streak Tracking**: Log your chapter every day and build an unstoppable streak. Miss a day, and your streak resets!
- **🏆 Leaderboard**: Compete with your friends! The leaderboard updates automatically and shows who’s at the top with the longest streak.
- **⏰ Friendly Reminders**: Did you forget to log your chapter for the day? No worries! The bot will send a reminder two hours before midnight. (Currently exclusive to AEST timezone)
- **🚨 Good Morning Announcements**: Start the day right with a daily leaderboard sent to the `#leaderboard` channel, reminding you who’s in the lead.
- **⚙️ Custom Templates**: Simply type `!template` in the chat to get a pre-formatted chapter summary template for easy tracking!
